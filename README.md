# ExpressServer
Description

This repository contains the source code for a robust and efficient Express server, configured to work with ElephantSQL for persistent data storage and Redis for caching and session management. The solution is designed to be scalable, secure, and easy to maintain, suitable for web applications requiring high availability and quick response times.

Features

Express: A minimalist and flexible web application framework for Node.js, offering a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
ElephantSQL: A PostgreSQL as a service solution, providing reliable and manageable SQL data storage, with easy setup and maintenance.
Redis: An in-memory data structure storage, used as a database, cache, and message broker, assisting in quick data retrieval and efficient session management.
To run the project, you'll need to execute docker compose up --build. It was also set up to work with ElephantSQL, but since it contains my personal password and details, I will not provide any link or password.
